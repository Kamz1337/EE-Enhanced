WINDOWS

First unpack the Intel compiler from "Unpack here before recompiling (Win).7z" to the same folder.
The compiler is of version 1.19.0dev

replace all "export" in "kernel.ispc" and "kernel_astc.ispc" with "static export" which prevents from generating *.exp and *.lib when building apps using this library

remember about applying the line in "kernel.ispc\ep_quant0367":
        if(channels==4 && ep[i*4+3]<=0.5f)err0=-1; // ESENTHEL CHANGED, BC7 allows to encode end points in 2 quantized modes, #1 standard, #2 add "0.5*levels" to all channels (1 extra bit precision, however it affects all channels at the same time, so if we have alpha=0, but RGB channels have smaller error with the extra 0.5 value, then alpha would get the +0.5 too, and it could destroy complete transparency, so this code always forces #1 version if we have alpha=0)

Both 32/64 Release configs were changed to:
General:
-Visual Studio 2022 (v143)
-Configuration type - static lib *.lib - instead of - DLL
-No Whole Program Optimization
C/C++
General:
-Debug Information Format - <empty>
Code Generation:
-Multi-Threaded - instead of - Multi-Threaded DLL
-SSE2 Instruction set (for Win32 only)

Merge latest changes from "ispc_texcomp\kernel.ispc"      to "kernel.ispc.cpp"      (which is a customized version to compile under regular C++ compiler)
Merge latest changes from "ispc_texcomp\kernel_astc.ispc" to "kernel_astc.ispc.cpp" (which is a customized version to compile under regular C++ compiler)
TortoiseMerge is recommended for merging changes

Recompile using VS
/******************************************************************************/
MAC

First unpack the Intel compiler from "Unpack here before recompiling (Mac).7z" to the same folder.
The compiler is of version 1.9.1

Xcode project properties changed:
Mach-O Type - static library

Also need to manually drag and drop generated "Build/Intermediates/*.o" files to the project to force linking them.

Recompile
even though we've selected static lib, the generated file will have *.dylib extension, because of that we need to do:
rename "Build\libispc_texcomp.dylib" to "Mac\libispc_texcomp.a"
